>>Hadoop logs errors upon startup on OS X 10.7
When starting Hadoop on OS X 10.7 ("Lion") using start-all.sh, Hadoop logs the following errors:
2011-07-28 11:45:31.469 java[77427:1a03] Unable to load realm info from SCDynamicStore
Hadoop does seem to function properly despite this.

I think the OS X JDK is trying to get some information from configd which is failing that causes the whole LoginContent to break.
This can be worked around by specifying kerberos config on the command line:
-Djava.security.krb5.realm=OX.AC.UK -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=kdc0.ox.ac.uk:kdc1.ox.ac.uk
For a standalone machine, you can just set the values to nothing.
Adding the following to your environment or hadoop-env.sh should suppress the errors:
export HADOOP_OPTS="-Djava.security.krb5.realm= -Djava.security.krb5.kdc="
